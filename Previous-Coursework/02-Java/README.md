# Introduction

This course is divided into two parts. 

The first part of the course introduces the Java Programming language, and the 4 concepts of object-oriented programming (abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism). The idea of abstract class and interface, file I/O and exception handling in Java is also discussed. 

The second part of the course focuses on the common data structures found in the Java Collections library, with a brief introduction on how these data structures are manipulated using various algorithms. 

Selected data structures include singly linked list, doubly linked list, stack, queue, priority queue, binary search tree and hash map. The discussion of big-O notation and amortized cost is also incorporated during the explanation of data structures.
