# Introduction

This course is an introduction to the algorithms and applications of deep learning. 

Topics covered are Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Reinforcement Learning, Object Detection, Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) and Autonomous Driving (self-driving vehicle). 

A project about reinforcement learning to play LunarLander-v2 is conducted. However, the project files and work are unavailable for preview due to ownership rights of my groupmates. 

# Workshops

Workshop 1 is about using the flowers dataset to perform image classification with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). 

Workshop 2 is about building a transformer for image classification. 

Workshop 3 is about training an agent to play LunarLander-v2 using the `gym` library. 

Workshop 4 is about object detection using `mmdetection` and Faster-RCNN.
