# Introduction

This course introduces the basics of Python programming, along with the usage of `numpy` and `pandas`. In the second half of the course, advanced topics such as linear regression and logistic regression are introduced, with the aid of the library `scikit-learn`. 

The course concludes with a group project where my group conducts research on whether Twitter sentiment has an effect on the stock returns in the US Stock Market. However, the project files and work are unavailable for preview due to ownership rights of my groupmates.

Assignment 1 Part I is about basic statistics and involves the usage of introductory Python. 

Assignment 1 Part II is about the basic usage of manipulating datasets using `pandas` and involves visualization tools such as `matplotlib` and `seaborn`. 

Assignment 2 involves the usage of `statsmodels.api` to run statistical tests and linear regression. 

Assignment 3 is about the basics of machine learning, with a gentle introduction in using `scikit-learn` with two datasets given. A regression task and a classification task is conducted and the performance of the models are evaluated using appropriate metrics.
